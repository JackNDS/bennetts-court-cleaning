                <p class="p-4">We are Anthony and Mitchell Bennett (father and son). Our family first entered the tennis court industry in 1965 Mitchells great grand parents Louise & Jim Bennett built 8 loam courts and 1 grass court for their own tennis centre on Sydneys northern beaches. Since then every member of our family has been entrenched in tennis playing, coaching, building and resurfacing courts, and of course cleaning courts. 
                </p>
            </div>
                <p class="lead">
                        <br><br>
                        In 2004 Anthony, while managing a large court construction and resurfacing business, set about inventing a new method of cleaning artificial grass tennis courts to achieve a “as new” finish”. He engaged with manufacturers of artificial grass, engineers, and other industry experts who all helped him design and build bespoke equipment and processes. All critical components were fabricated as “one offs” so they are genuinely unique. 
                        We nicknamed the system “Scuba” and it stuck. Scuba cleans courts in a similar fashion to how carpets are steam cleaned. In one single process Scuba extracts all the sand, algae, dirt, moss, etc, from the synthetic grass and separates them so it leaves behind clean sand and washes everything else down the drain. During that process, Scuba cleans the synthetic grass fibres. We then have a unique technique of re-sanding the court using the spotlessly clean sand, leaving the surface in a “as new” condition. No chemicals are required, and at no stage is any part of the court damaged in any way. The court is ready to play on when we leave the court.<br>
                        There have been well over 1,000 courts brought back to “as new” by our Scuba system. Others have tried to copy the system, but you cannot purchase our equipment (it is not an off the shelf rotary high pressure washer) so nobody has succeeded.
                        <br><br>
                        Mitchell did his first court clean using Scuba in 2009, and has done a lot since on a part time basis. He has become an expert, and in mid 2021 decided to give up his full time job and start a business specialising in cleaning tennis courts; hence the birth of Bennetts Court Cleaning. Mitchell personally does every job, and is helped by Anthony and/or someone else as required. Anthony does most of the quoting (which is free of course).
                        <br><br>
                        Your tennis court is treated by us like its our own court. We are perfectionists and therefore every court is finished to the highest possible standard every time. Your court and surrounds will be left spotless when we leave, and ready for you to immediately enjoy using.
                        <br><br>
                        We expect to exceed your expectations and leave you believing the job was excellent value. So confident are we that we tell every client to not pay us unless that is the outcome. 
                        <br><br>
                        Feel free to call us any time.
